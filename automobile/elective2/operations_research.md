# Syllabus

## OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AM 76502

### Course Objective

To make capable of managing data, analyzing data such as sorting, pivoting tables, and applying statistical analysis in a spreadsheet environment. To familiarize with forecasting methods, linear programming, and inventory models. To make familiar with simulation in decision-making under risk and uncertainty with the use of risk analysis software such as CRYSTAL BALL. To make capable in applying the knowledge gained during the course for solving real problems in decision-making.
