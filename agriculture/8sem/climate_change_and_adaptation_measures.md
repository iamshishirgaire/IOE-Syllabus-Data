    - **Oceanic climate change and sea level** - changes in global scale temperature and salinity, regional, changes in ocean circulation and water masses, ocean biogeochemical changes in sea level.
6. **Global climate projections [4 hours]** 
    - Overview projected changes in emissions concentration and radioactive forcing projected changes in the physical climate system changes associated with biogeochemical feedbacks and ocean acidification.
