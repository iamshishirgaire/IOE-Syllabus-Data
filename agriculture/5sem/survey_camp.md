### SURVEY CAMP

**Practical: 10 days**

**Course Objective:**

The survey camp is scheduled after the completion of the second year second part theory exam. It has the following objective for 10 days of intensive fieldwork:

* **To provide students with real field-based exposure to learn and apply different surveying methods in:**
    * Mapping detailed land features
    * Mapping and describing topographical variations
    * Planning irrigation, drainage, land farming, soil conservation, and watershed management works
* **To accomplish a project-based surveying task focusing on:**
    * Detailed survey of irrigation command area
    * Detailed survey of main canal alignment and headwork
    * L-section and cross-section of Rural Roads
    * Soil conservation and farm leveling works e.g. - gully control, stream bank control, terracing, bunding, check dams.

**Requirements:**

Students in each camp group should not be more than 4 (four). For conducting the camp, as far as possible, modern surveying equipment such as Total Station, EDM, Digital level, etc. should be used.

**Implementation of the Survey Camp:**

Field work will be conducted between the second and third years; and its evaluation will be submitted in the third year part A based on the field/project work produced by the students & viva-voce conducted at the end of the fieldwork.

The Survey Camp shall be implemented jointly by the Department of Civil and Agricultural Engineering. The camp site should be objective-oriented so that students could gain ample opportunity to learn, consolidate and update their practical and theoretical knowledge in the Agricultural Engineering field.

### Evaluation Scheme:

* 50 marks - Internal Assignment i.e. field work and viva-voce
* 50 marks - Field report and viva voce
