This course is prerequisite to course AR 851 listed in Year V Part II. This course objective needs to be read in conjunction with the following requirements of Thesis:\n\nA thesis in architecture is expected to be a solution of a creative design problem (of a building complex, a building, or elements of a building) that may have differing focus as seen from the perspective of different support courses such as environment, ecology, energy, climatology, design theory, planning, materials and technology of construction, services, and the like. The thesis aims to demonstrate the students' ability and development to pursue analytical investigations related to the design of a building and/or its cultural, social, economic, material, climatic, technological, etc. dimensions. It should balance research and design application components. It should respond to contemporary issues in architecture and design.\n\nThe following component of works leading to the thesis has to be completed in this semester:\n\n1. **Thesis topic, project justification, and requirement assessment:** The topic of thesis and its scope shall be finalized in consultation with the assigned thesis supervisor and the thesis supervision faculty. Requirement assessment shall include space, services, environment, ecology, energy, and other design requirements of the proposed project.

            "content": "The objective of the project work is to equip students with skills required to synthesize comprehensively the knowledge gained during course works for a practical application of civil engineering discipline in real life. Under the supervision and guidance of faculty members, each student is required to carry out an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling problems in Civil Engineering and is required to submit a project report.\n\nThe choice of project will depend upon the interests of students, faculty, and the facilities available on campus.\n\nA project may involve:\n\n1. Preparation of a design for an extensive Civil Engineering project\n2. Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey and a correlation of existing knowledge\n3. An experimental investigation\n\nThe project work is divided into two parts, viz. Project –I and Project –II. In Project-I, students are required to complete the following works for the above-mentioned categories of project works:\n\n1. **Design type project**\n    * Background\n    * Project Description\n    * Study Area\n    * Literature Review/Guidelines etc.\n    * Methodology\n    * Field data collection and plotting\n2. **Dissertation type project**\n    * Background\n    * Need of the research\n    * Objectives and scope of the work\n    * Literature Review\n    * Study area\n    * Methodology\n    * Data collection and compilation\n3. **Experimental type project**\n    * Background\n    * Need of the research\n    * Objectives and scope of the work\n    * Literature Review\n    * Experimental setup\n    * Methodology\n    * Data collection and compilation\n\nIn the initial phase, the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions regarding the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on their own to pursue their work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem arises. They should then submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct any mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.\n\n\n"

Under the supervision and guidance of member/members of faculty each student is required to carry out an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling problem to civil Engineering and is required to submit a project report.  \nThe choice of project will depend upon the interests of students, faculty and the facilities available in the campus.  \nA project may involve:\n1. Preparation of a design for an extensive Geomatics Engineering project\n2. Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey and a correlation of existing knowledge\n3. An experimental investigation\n\nThe project work is divided into two parts, viz Project –I and Project –II. In Project-I students are required to complete following works for above mentioned categories of project works:\n\n1. **Design type project**\n2. **Dissertation type project**\n3. **Experimental type project**\nIn the initial phase the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions as to the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on his own to pursue his work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem crops up. He/She should then submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct the mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.\n"
