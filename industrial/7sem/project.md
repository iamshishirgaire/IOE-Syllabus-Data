## Syllabus

### **PROJECT**

**Course Objective** 
After completion of this course, students will be able to plan and complete an individual mechanical engineering design project under the supervision of an instructor and prepare a written report and give an oral examination.

**General Procedures**

The project course will involve working on a design project under the supervision of a staff member in the Department of Industrial Engineering. The subject of the project should be as relevant as possible to the local industrial environment and may be selected in consultation with an industrial firm or government departments. Students are advised to select the project topic at the beginning of the term (A of the fourth year). The consultation hour of the supervisor will be 6 hours in part A of the fourth year. Course requirements will include:

1. A detailed project proposal is to be submitted to the Department within 2 weeks of the start of the term. The HOD and supervisor will appraise the submitted report for its feasibility.
2. A duly typed mid-term progress report is to be submitted within 6 weeks of the start of the term (part A of the fourth year). Students will then be required to give a presentation to a committee which comprises of faculty members and the supervisor.
3. A final written report (in the provided format by the department) will be submitted before the end of the 12th week of the term (4th year, part A). This report will be evaluated by the supervisor, members of the examination committee and an external examiner. This will account for 80 marks.

An oral examination of the final report will be conducted during the 15th week of the term (4th year, Part A) at a time convenient to the examination committee, supervisor and the student. The final oral examination will account for 75 marks.
