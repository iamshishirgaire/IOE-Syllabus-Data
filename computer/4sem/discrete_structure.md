## **Evaluation Scheme:**

The questions will cover all the chapters of the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

| Chapters | Hours | Marks Distribution* |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 12 | 24 |
| 2 | 10 | 16 |
| 3 | 8 | 8 |
| 4 | 15 | 32 |
| **Total** | **45** | **80** |

*There could be a minor deviation in Marks distribution
