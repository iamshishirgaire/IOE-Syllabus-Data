## Syllabus: TOOL DESIGN FOR ECONOMIC PRODUCTION

**Course Objectives:**

After completion of the course, students will appreciate and understand the critical relationship between tooling, design, cost, and production. They will be able to apply jigs and fixtures in production and design them according to specific needs.

**Course Outline:**

1. **Cutting tools for productive machining (12 hours)**
   - Mechanics of metal cutting
   - Cutting tools materials
   - Machinability
   - Economics of machining
   - Modern cutting tool techniques

2. **Press tools (8 hours)**
   - Types of presses
   - Computation of capacities and tonnage requirements for blanking, piercing, bending, forming, and drawing operations
   - Principles and design procedures for press tools
   - Detailed design procedure for bending operation with examples

3. **Forging dies (8 hours)**
   - Types of forging equipment and operations
   - Component and materials design for forging
   - Die design for drop and press forging
   - Die design for machine forging
   - Tools for flash trimming and hole piercing

4. **Jigs and Fixtures – introduction (5 hours)**
   - Definitions of jigs and fixtures
   - Function of jigs and fixtures
   - Analysis of locating, clamping, and guiding methods
   - Work holding principles of flat, round, and irregular surfaces and methods of holding them

5. **Design of drill jigs (5 hours)**
   - Types of drill jigs
   - Jig and machine relationship
   - Jig body and jig feet
   - Examples of typical drill jigs:
     - Plate jig, solid jig, turn over jig
     - Pot and post jig, swing-latch jig
     - Box jig, indexing drill jig

6. **Design of fixtures (7 hours)**
   - Types of milling fixtures
   - Fixtures and machine relationship
   - Examples of typical milling fixtures:
     - Plain milling fixtures, string milling fixtures
     - Gang milling fixtures, indexing milling fixtures
   - Design of turning, grinding, and broaching fixtures

**Practical:**

Minimum of THREE assignments on Design, manufacture, and use of a complete set of tooling for a component.
