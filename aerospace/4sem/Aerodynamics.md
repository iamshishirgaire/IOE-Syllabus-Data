## **Subject Content**

## Course Objectives:
This course builds on the student's background in Fluid Mechanics to deal primarily with internal and external flows (low-speed and high speed) relevant to aerospace applications. Students are expected to be able to analyse flows past airfoils, wings as well as nozzles and diffusers which form the basic building blocks of an airplane.

1. **Introduction (7 hours)**
   1. Lift, drag, moment and related coefficients;
   2. Vector operations (review);
   3. Conservation equations (mass, momentum and energy);
   4. Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines;
   5. Velocity potential and stream function

2. **Inviscid, Incompressible flow (6 hours)**
   1. Bernoulli's equation, low-speed wind tunnel flows;
   2. Governing equations and boundary conditions;
   3. Elementary flows (uniform, sources, sinks and vortex);
   4. Ideal lifting flow past a circular cylinder,
   5. Kutta-Joukowski theorem and lift generation;
   6. Source panel method for non-lifting flows;
   7. d' Alembert's paradox.

3. **Incompressible flow over airfoils (5 hours)**
   1. Introduction; Kutta Condition;
   2. Thin airfoil theory (symmetric, cambered);
   3. Aerodynamic center;
   4. vortex panel method for lifting flows;
   5. qualitative picture of viscous flow.

4. **Finite Wing Theory (6 hours)**
   1. Introduction; Downwash and induced drag;
   2. Biot-Savart Law and Helmholtz's Theorems;
   3. Prandtl's lifting line theory;
   4. Numerical lifting-line method;
   5. Some practical aspects.

5. **Introduction to Compressible flows (Inviscid) (5 hours)**
   1. Thermodynamics review;
   2. Governing equations;
   3. Compressibility.

6. **Normal Shock, Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves (8 hours)**
   1. Basic relations; flow over wedges and cones;
   2. shock interactions; blunt body flow;
   3. Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves;
   4. qualitative picture of shock wave-boundary layer interaction;
   5. quasi-one-dimensional flow through nozzles and diffusers.

7. **Linearized Theory for Subsonic and Supersonic Flows (6 hours)**
   1. Introduction; Velocity potential equation and linearized form;
