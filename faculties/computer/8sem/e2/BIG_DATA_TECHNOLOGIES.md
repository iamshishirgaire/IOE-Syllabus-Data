# Syllabus: BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES (CT 765 07)

## Course Objectives:

The growth of information systems has given rise to large amounts of data that don't fit the traditional definition of data. This presents new possibilities but also significant challenges, particularly in effective storage, analysis, and search of such massive datasets. Fortunately, various technologies have been developed to address these challenges. This course introduces this scenario, exploring the technologies involved and how they overcome these challenges.

Specifically, the course aims to:

* Introduce students to the current landscape of big data and its various facets.
* Familiarize students with technologies playing a key role in big data.
* Equip students with the necessary knowledge to utilize these technologies for solving big data problems in different domains.

## Course Outline:

1. **Introduction to Big Data [7 hours]**

## Practical:

Students will have the opportunity to work with big data technologies using various dummy and real-world problems that cover all aspects discussed in the course. This practical experience will provide insights into the challenges faced and how to tackle them using the tools learned.

* **HDFS:** Setup a single-node HDFS to a multi-node cluster, perform basic file system operations using commands, and monitor cluster performance.
* **Map-Reduce:** Write various MR programs dealing with different aspects of Map-Reduce as studied in the course.
* **Hbase:** Setup Hbase in single-node and distributed mode, write programs to write data into Hbase and query it.
* **Elastic Search:** Setup Elastic Search in single-mode and distributed mode, define templates, write data, and perform queries.
* **Final Assignment:** A final assignment covering all aspects studied in order to demonstrate the student's problem-solving capabilities in a big data scenario.
