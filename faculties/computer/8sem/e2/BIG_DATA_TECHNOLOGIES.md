## Practical:

Students will have the opportunity to work with big data technologies using various dummy and real-world problems that cover all aspects discussed in the course. This practical experience will provide insights into the challenges faced and how to tackle them using the tools learned.

* **HDFS:** Setup a single-node HDFS to a multi-node cluster, perform basic file system operations using commands, and monitor cluster performance.
* **Map-Reduce:** Write various MR programs dealing with different aspects of Map-Reduce as studied in the course.
* **Hbase:** Setup Hbase in single-node and distributed mode, write programs to write data into Hbase and query it.
* **Elastic Search:** Setup Elastic Search in single-mode and distributed mode, define templates, write data, and perform queries.
* **Final Assignment:** A final assignment covering all aspects studied in order to demonstrate the student's problem-solving capabilities in a big data scenario.
