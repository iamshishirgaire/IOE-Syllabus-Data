### Tutorial/Practical:

* Each student will work on individual assignments with problems related to the lecture material.
* Assignments will involve the application of software packages such as FORTRAN, Matlab, Mathematica, and SAP 2000.
* All assignments are due within a specified timeframe and will be evaluated as practical work.
