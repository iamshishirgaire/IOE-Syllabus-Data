## Syllabus: Theory of Structures II

**Course Objective:**

The objective of this course is threefold:

1. To familiarize students with the terminologies and concepts of displacements, stresses, strains, stiffness etc., and their parameters in the context of indeterminate systems.
2. To provide practical examples illustrating the basic concepts and theorems on static (equilibrium), geometrical (compatibility), and physical (Force, stiffness, and displacements) conditions in the context of indeterminate systems.
3. To prepare students for advanced courses in structural mechanics by introducing them to necessary tools like matrix method, force method, displacement method, plastic analysis etc.
