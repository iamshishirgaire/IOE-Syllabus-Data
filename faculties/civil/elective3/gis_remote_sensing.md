## Syllabus - GIS Application and Remote Sensing (CE 78501)

**Course Objectives:**

This course introduces the principles, concepts, and applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS is a powerful decision support tool for planners and managers working with spatial information. This course focuses on database development, manipulation, and spatial analysis techniques for information generation. Students will explore the application of GIS in their respective fields, including natural resource management, environmental studies, civil engineering, agriculture, and information systems, through mini-projects and laboratory exercises.
