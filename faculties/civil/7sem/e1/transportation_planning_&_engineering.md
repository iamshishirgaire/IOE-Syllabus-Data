### Practical/Assignment

Students will prepare a report regarding the current state of affairs on subjects related to air transportation, rail transportation, ropeway, and/or any other modes of transportation in the local context. Students will present the report for evaluation, which will be part of their assessment marks. Depending on the nature of the subject matter, students can be grouped (with a maximum of 4 students per group) for submission and subsequent presentation.
