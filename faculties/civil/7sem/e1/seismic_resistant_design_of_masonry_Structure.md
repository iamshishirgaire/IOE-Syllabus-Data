### Tutorial

* Design of Walls for Gravity Load (Review)
* Calculation of Lateral Load from Code
* Design of Walls
* Design of Reinforced Masonry Walls (Flexure and Shear)

### Practical / Project Work

Design a 2-3 storey masonry building considering seismic load. 
(The students should carry out a survey of a masonry building and select one of the buildings for design. Each student shall submit a design for a unique building.)
