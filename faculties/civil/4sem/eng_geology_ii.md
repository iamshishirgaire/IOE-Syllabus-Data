## Syllabus - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY II

**Course Objective:** This course provides knowledge of Engineering Geology to civil engineering students. It helps students understand how to measure geological data in the field, analyze and interpret it for civil infrastructure development, ensure stability, and provide input for design parameters.

### Course Outline:

1. **Introduction to Engineering Geology (3 hours)**
    * Engineering geological system (EGS): Rocks, soils, geological structures, geomorphology, hydrogeology, weathering, earthquakes & seismicity, geotechnical categorization of projects, and EGS evaluation for infrastructure development (planning, design, construction, maintenance).
    * Important rock-forming minerals and their engineering significance.
    * Applications of engineering geology in various civil engineering projects (roads, irrigation systems, tunnels, dams, reservoirs, etc.).
    * Engineering geological maps: classification and preparation.
2. **Engineering Geology in the Himalayas (3 hours)**
    * Major discontinuity systems in the Nepal Himalayas and their engineering significance.
    * Major engineering geological problems in the Terai, Siwaliks, Lesser Himalayas, Higher Himalayas, Tibetan-Tethys zone, and their mitigation.
    * Importance of engineering geological information systems in the Nepalese context.
3. **Hydrogeology (2 hours)**
    * River channel morphology.
    * Origin, types, and movement of groundwater; porosity, permeability, and hydraulic transmissivity of various rocks and sediments.
    * Geological factors in the formation of different hydrological conditions.
    * Different types of aquifer systems in Nepal (Terai, hills, and mountains).
4. **Engineering Geology in Site Selection, Investigation, and Construction/Excavation (5 hours)**
    * Introduction, types, and methods.
    * Geology in the selection of road and canal alignments.
    * Geology in site investigations for buildings, bridges, dams, and reservoirs.
    * Geology in the selection of tunnels and other underground structures.
    * Engineering geological documentation during tunneling and underground excavations.
5. **Geological Hazards (6 Hours)**
    * Introduction.
    * Major geological hazards: floods, GLOFs (glacial lake outburst floods), erosion, mass movement, their causes, and types of mass movement.
    * Earthquakes and seismicity.
    * Structural control on geo-hazards.
    * Geological hazards in soil mass and rock mass.
    * Engineering evaluation of geological hazards and risks, problem-specific hazard mapping, and mitigation measures.
6. **Measurement, Analysis, and Interpretation of Structural Geological Data (8 hours)**
    * Rock mass: introduction, properties, classification systems.
    * Measurement of structural geological data from rock mass.
    * Stereographic projection: plotting a line and plane.
    * Structural analysis: principles, phases of analysis, analysis of structural geological data using stereo nets, rose diagrams, block diagrams, and histograms.
    * Determination of the mean value of major discontinuity sets.
    * Interpretation of structural geological data for specific engineering geological problems.
7. **Geology and Construction Materials (3 hours)**
    * Aggregates and construction materials: clay, sand, limestone and marble, slates, and other building stones.
    * Requirements for selecting borrow areas.
    * Searching, exploration, and reserve estimation for construction materials.
    * Use of geological, engineering geological, and topographic maps and aerial photographs in searching for construction materials.
    * Application of geomorphology in searching for construction materials.

### Practical:

* Eight practical exercises will be performed in this course, in addition to two days of fieldwork.
    * Study of engineering geological maps: preparation, interpretation.
    * Study of borehole problems.
    * Study of bedrock thickness.
    * Study of construction material reserve estimation.
    * Study of mineral distribution in sand using a binocular microscope.
    * Study and analysis of discontinuity data for failure mechanism: by stereographic projection/using a stereo net.
    * Study of weathering profiles and their effect on rock mass properties.
    * Exercise on rock mass classification systems and their uses.

### Field Work (Two Days):

* Any one of the following:
    * Road/highway projects under construction or with severe geo-hazard problems.
    * Hydropower projects under construction.
* Attendance in fieldwork is compulsory.
