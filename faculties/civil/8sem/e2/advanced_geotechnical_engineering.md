### Evaluation Scheme:

The questions will cover all the chapters in the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

| Chapter   | Hours  | Marks Distribution* |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1         | 2      | 4                   |
| 2         | 12     | 20                  |
| 3         | 9      | 16                  |
| 4         | 9      | 16                  |
| 5         | 4      | 8                   |
| 6         | 9      | 16                  |
| **Total** | **45** | **80**              |

*There could be minor deviation in mark distribution.
