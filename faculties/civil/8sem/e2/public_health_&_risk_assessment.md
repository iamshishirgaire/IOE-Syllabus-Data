## Syllabus

### **PUBLIC HEALTH AND RISK ASSESSMENT**
### **CE 76520**

**Course Objectives:**

This course broadens and deepens the concept of epidemiological studies and methodology, with a focus on environmental transmission. The students will work on cases related to diarrhoeal, parasitic and vector-borne diseases. The students will learn and be able to apply the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) concept. The students will be able to apply their knowledge in field projects as well as in system-based management applications.

### **Topics:**

1. **Fundamentals of Epidemiology** (5 hours)
    - Infectious and noninfectious diseases
    - Infectious disease transmission routes
    - Organic and inorganic contaminants
    - Health and water quality

2. **Pathogens (Excreta Bacteria, Viruses Protozoa, Helminthes) and their Control** (10 hours)
    - Disease transmitted by arthropod vectors
        - Mosquito
        - Flies
        - Cockroaches
        - Ticks
        - Lice
        - Fleas
        - Rodents
        - Disease transmission mechanism and control
    - Water-related
    - Excreta-related
    - Refuse-related
    - Housing-related
    - Air-related diseases
    - Control HIV/AIDS

3. **Sample and Questionnaire** (8 hours)
    - Questionnaire-based approaches
    - Statistical handling and link to GIS based approaches
    - Surveys both in societies and in agricultural applications

4. **Risk Assessment** (8 hours)
    - Risk Assessment within an integrated system approach
    - Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA)
    - QMRA relates to risk reduction

    - Handling practices

5. **Relationship Between Public Health and the Risk Assessment Parts with the WHO Guidelines for** (8 hours)
    - Water
    - Wastewater
    - Water safety plan to avoid fecal contamination

6. **Case Studies** (6 hours)
    - Case studies based on public health and the risk assessment

### **Tutorials:**
