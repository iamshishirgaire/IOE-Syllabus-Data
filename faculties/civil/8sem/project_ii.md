In the initial phase, the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions regarding the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on their own to pursue their work and consult the faculty whenever a problem arises. They should then compile Project Work I and Project Work II write-ups and submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct any mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.
