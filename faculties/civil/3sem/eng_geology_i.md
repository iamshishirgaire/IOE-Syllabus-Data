## **ENGINEERING GEOLOGY I**

### **Course Objective:**

This course has been designed to provide basic knowledge of geology to the students of civil engineering. It would be helpful for them to understand how to identify the different types of rocks, minerals, geological structures, geological processes and their impacts on engineering structures etc. Furthermore, the course will help students to know about the geological setting of Himalaya, geological structures for development of infrastructures.

### **Course Content**

    * Different branches of geology and their interrelations
    * Scope, objective and importance of geology in civil engineering
    * Definition of engineering geology (according to IAEG), role and tasks of an engineering geologist, scope, objectives and its importance in the context of Nepal.

2. **Basic Reviews of the Earth** (3 hours)
    * The Earth: its origin, age, components, structure.
    * Introduction to history of the Earth: Geological time scale, origin and evolution of life.
    * Physical features of the earth surface: Continental & oceanic features, mountains, plateau and shields.
    * Internal structure of the Earth.
    * Plate tectonics and mountain building process and formation of the Himalayas.

3. **Crystallography & Mineralogy** (4 hours)
    * Introduction and crystal morphology, symmetry elements, crystal form & habits and crystal system.

    * Rock and rock cycle: Introduction.
    * Classification, structure, textures of rocks.
    * Engineering Significance of three rock classes.
    * Macroscopic study of rocks on the basis of physical and engineering properties of following common rock types found in earth crust: Granite, Ryhyollite, Gabbro, Basalt, Pegmatite, Syenite Shale, Siltstone, limestone, Sandstone, Conglomerate, Breccia, slate, Phyllite, Schist, Gneiss, Quartzite, Marble

5. **Structural Geology** (5 hours)
    * Rock deformations and reasons.
    * Attitude of geological structures: Dip, strike, trend, plunge.
    * Measurement of orientation of geological strata using geological maps, geological compass and plotting of data on map.
    * Geological structures: Primary sedimentary structures (bedding plane, lamination, cross bedding, graded bedding ripple marks, mud cracks etc.)
    * Secondary (deformation) structures: Continuous (lineation, foliation, boudinage, crenulation cleavage, folds) and discontinuous (cracks fractures, joints, faults & thrusts).
    * Field identification criteria of geological structures.
    * Engineering significance of geological structures.

6. **Physical Geology** (8 hours)
    * Introduction: Definition, different geological agents.
    * Geomorphological processes: Weathering and erosion.
    * Geological cycle.
    * Geological agents: Running water, glaciers, groundwater, wind and sea water, and various landforms produced by the geomorphological agents.
    * Volcanism.

7. **Geology of Nepal** (2 hours)
    * Introduction to the physiography and tectonic division of the Nepal Himalaya.
    * Geology of the Terai Zone.
    * Geology of the Siwalik Zone.
    * Geology of the Lesser Himalaya Zone.
    * Geology of the Higher Himalaya Zone.
    * Geology of the Tethys Himalaya Zone.
