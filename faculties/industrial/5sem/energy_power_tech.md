## Syllabus

**ENERGY, POWER, AND TECHNOLOGY**

**Course Objective:**

After the completion of this course, students will have an overview of clean energy technology and outline of the basic principles of solar electricity, solar water heating, wind power, micro hydro, biomass, bio-fuel, bio-diesel etc. and their applications in urban and rural environments. The emphasis is on how things work and what it is practicable to do.
