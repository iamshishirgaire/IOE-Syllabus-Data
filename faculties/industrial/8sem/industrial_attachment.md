**Methodology**

In consultation with the department, students will select an industry, workshop, or organization where they will work for approximately 90 working days. The chosen institution or organization will assess the students' performance and submit an evaluation to the department.

* Students will perform tasks assigned by the company/factory/institution.
* A guide assigned by the company/factory/institution will assess each student's performance based on punctuality, behavior, performance, and knowledge. This assessment will be confidentially provided to the department of industrial engineering.
* A supervisor assigned by the department will visit the company at least once during the OJT period, maintaining contact with both the student and the company/factory/institution. The supervisor will report the student's performance to the department.
* Students must prepare a report according to standards set by both the company and the department.
