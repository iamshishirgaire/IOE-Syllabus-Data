**Practical Components:**

1. **Homework Problems:** Traditional homework problems will be assigned periodically from the textbook. These problems may include derivations and analytical problems requiring hand computations.

2. **Assignments:** 5 projects will be assigned throughout the semester requiring the use of Simulation Software. These projects are to be done individually. A brief report describing the objectives of the analysis, modelling techniques used, and results must be submitted for each project.

3. **Group Design Project/Research Project:** A group design project will also be required by the end of the semester. This project will be conceived by the group, must be of a "design" nature (no unique answer will exist), and will require the use of Simulation Software (with more than one iteration). Groups of 3-4 people will work on the project. A final report must be submitted detailing the objectives, modelling techniques and assumptions, and results of the project. In place of a design project, students are required to complete a research-oriented project that uses advanced capabilities of Simulation Software.

4. **Case Study:** Industrial Engineering problems study and analysis.
