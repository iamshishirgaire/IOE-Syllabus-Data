**General Procedures**

The project course will involve working on an engineering project under the supervision of a faculty member in the concerned department. The subject of the project should be as relevant as possible to the local industrial environment and may be selected in consultation with an industrial firm or government departments. The project should be completed by the end of the fourth year starting from the beginning of Part I according to the procedures described below.

Students should select the project topic at the beginning of Part I. Students should submit a feasible project proposal within 2 weeks from the start of the semester and should submit weekly progress reports. Mid-term progress will be evaluated at the end of Part I on which students should submit a progress report, give a presentation, and face a viva voce examination. The consultation hour of the supervisor will be three hours per week.
