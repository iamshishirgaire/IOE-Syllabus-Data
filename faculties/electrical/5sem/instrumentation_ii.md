**Practical:**

The laboratory exercises deal interfacing techniques using microprocessor or microcontrollers. There will be about six lab sessions which should cover at least following:

1. Simple and Handshake data transfer using PPI.
2. Basic I/O device interfacing like keyboard, seven segments, motors etc
3. Analog to Digital interfacing
4. Digital to Analog interfacing
5. Design exercise (small group project)

Study in detail the instrumentation requirements of a particular proposed or existing industrial plant and design an instrumentation and data collection system for that particular industrial plant. The final report should present the instrumentation requirements in terms of engineering specifications, the hardware solution suggested, a listing of the particular devices chosen to satisfy the requirements, appropriate system flow diagrams, wiring diagrams, etc. to show how the system would be connected and operated.
