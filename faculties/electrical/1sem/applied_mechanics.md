## APPLIED MECHANICS

**Course Objective:** 

This course has been designed to provide basic knowledge of engineering mechanics to the students of all branches of engineering so that it would be helpful for them to understand structural engineering stress analysis principles in later courses or to use basics of mechanics in their branch of engineering. This course shall be considered as an introduction: common for all engineering faculties of Tribhuvan University in the first year of undergraduate. Emphasis has been given to Statics.
