## Syllabus: Construction of Micro Hydropower System

**Course Objectives:**

1. To provide basic concepts of planning and preparation for Micro Hydropower (MHP) systems, including knowledge of installation planning, preparation, and construction.
2. To present concepts for commissioning and testing of MHP systems. To explore maintenance, repair, and bill of quantities preparation. The syllabus also covers the future prospects of MHP projects in Nepal and a literature study of potential MHP projects.
