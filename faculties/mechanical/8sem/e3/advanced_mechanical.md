### Practical

The laboratory work will be closely connected with lecture and classroom work, and should generally be of a qualitative nature.

1. Critic writing exercise on project thesis by undergraduate students.
2. Convert a selected sketch to an actual working component.
3. Development analysis and technical advancement study of selected product.
4. Concept development for design and decision making by pair comparison.
5. New product design and development.
