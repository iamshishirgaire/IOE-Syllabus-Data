### Practical

1. **Homework Problems**
    * Traditional homework problems will be assigned periodically from the textbook. These problems may include derivations and analytical problems requiring hand computations.
2. **Assignments**
    * 5 projects will be assigned throughout the semester requiring the use of Simulation Software. These projects are to be done individually. A brief report describing the objectives of the analysis, modelling techniques used, and results must be submitted for each project.
3. **Group Design Project / Research Project**
    * A group design project will also be required by the end of the semester. This project will be conceived by the group, must be of a “design” nature (no unique answer will exist), and will require the use of Simulation Software (with more than one iteration). Groups of 3-4 people will work on the project. A final report must be submitted detailing the objectives, modelling techniques and assumptions, and results of the project. In place of a design project, students are required to complete a research-oriented project that uses advanced capabilities of Simulation Software.
4. **Case study**
    * Industrial Engineering problems study and analysis
