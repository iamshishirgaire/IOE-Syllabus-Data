## THESIS DESIGN

**Course Objective:**

A thesis in architecture is expected to be a solution of a creative design problem (of a building complex, a building or elements of a building) that may have differing focus as seen from the perspective of different support courses such as environment, ecology, energy, design theory, climatology, planning, materials and technology of construction, services and the like. **The thesis aims to demonstrate the students’ ability and development to pursue analytical investigations related to the design of a building and/or its cultural, social, economic, material, climatic, technological, etc. dimensions.** It should balance research and design application components. It should respond to contemporary issues in architecture and design.

The thesis design will be as per the proposal approved in the earlier semester and will be approached on the basis of research outcomes thereof. The students will undertake any additional research and study as needed. It will lead to the following final output:

1. **Design/Drawing component:** Drawings to fully explain conceptualization, development and design of the approved project. The output will be in form of presentation drawings. The drawings shall at least pertain to site and layouts, plans as required, four elevations and at least two sections, two perspectives, 3D drawings and model as necessary to fully explain the concept and design. Students shall seek prior approval for use of different sizes of drawings.
2. **Explanatory Component:** The thesis shall also contain a written explanatory section describing the concept/design and this section will be illustrated with A4 size schematic drawings of the proposal. Thesis report shall include the proposal, fundamental research process and findings, case study analysis and findings as separate chapters. [Size A4 for written, illustrative and explanatory components: Black on white. Sketches and limited number of BW Photographs]
3. **Submission for Department records and study completion:** Final of Thesis Report with an appendix of photographic reproductions of all drawings and Models. 

*Multi media presentations supplements may be allowed with permission but this shall not replace the drawings and models.* 

The studio works will be reviewed in the following stages of design exercise:

1. **Conceptual Design: [28 hours]**

   The first stage of submissions and presentations will be expressions of ideas and concepts in design and planning for the approved thesis project based on guidelines and conclusions (points of departures and cautions) from the research and case studies done in the previous semester or additional studies done afterwards to:

   * Meet the demands of comments made during the case study presentations
   * Make analysis of the site for design purposes
   * Think up some basic ideas
   * Apply these together to formulate planning and design concepts
   * Draw and present the concepts in the form of basic/explanatory sketches/drawings. Concepts will be produced as 'presentation drawings and sketches'. 
   

2. **Preliminary Design: [28 hours]**

   At this stage the concepts will be detailed into designs and a presentation of major aspects of the design shall be made in the preliminary form with, say, single line drawings in orthographic plans/elevations/sections or perspectives and/or with simple models in paper, wood etc. – they should explain the translation of the idea/concept into the design. Review team shall include at least one internal faculty.


3. **Design Development: [28 hours]**

   Further development of designs shall be made along with sufficient consideration of form, style, energy, services, structure, construction, safety and security, etc. and output presented in form of presentation drawings. The drawings shall at least pertain to site and layouts, plans as required, four elevations and at least two sections, two perspectives or model and as necessary to fully explain the concept and design. Review team shall include at least one faculty from other colleges.


4. **THESIS FINAL SUBMISSION [21 hours]** 

   For Jury Review including a Draft Thesis report
