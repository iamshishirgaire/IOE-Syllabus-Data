## Syllabus: Thesis Proposal and Research

**Course Objective:**

To enable the student to prepare a proposal for design thesis and to plan, undertake, and report on necessary research needed to undertake the proposed design thesis. This course is prerequisite to course AR 851 listed in Year V Part II. This course objective needs to be read in conjunction with the following requirements of Thesis:

A thesis in architecture is expected to be a solution of a creative design problem (of a building complex, a building, or elements of a building) that may have differing focus as seen from the perspective of different support courses such as environment, ecology, energy, climatology, design theory, planning, materials and technology of construction, services, and the like. The thesis aims to demonstrate the students' ability and development to pursue analytical investigations related to the design of a building and/or its cultural, social, economic, material, climatic, technological, etc. dimensions. It should balance research and design application components. It should respond to contemporary issues in architecture and design.

The following component of works leading to the thesis has to be completed in this semester:

1. **Thesis topic, project justification, and requirement assessment:** The topic of thesis and its scope shall be finalized in consultation with the assigned thesis supervisor and the thesis supervision faculty. Requirement assessment shall include space, services, environment, ecology, energy, and other design requirements of the proposed project. [6 hours]

2. **Thesis proposal:** The thesis proposal must be submitted in proper form for department records and must include:
    * Introduction to the proposed thesis
    * The need and importance (justification)
    * Requirements
    * Fundamental research themes and case studies
    * Client and site information
    * Expected output of research as well as the thesis
    The submission will be marked. [9 hours]

3. **Basic Research:** This component of the course will require students to take up fundamental research and literature review (including architectural standards) on the functional and philosophical nature of the proposed thesis topic. Research on technological, environmental, and ecological issues may be encouraged. The presentation shall be marked by a review team. [15 hours]

4. **Case study:** Students should take up cases of similar exemplary design projects or components of a project for detailed study. The cases may be analyzed from the perspective of form, function, and technique. Studies may be made for all or some major determinants of design such as climate/sun/wind/rain, materials/their use and behavior, socio-cultural factors, functional reflections, etc. The presentation shall be marked by a review team. [15 hours]
