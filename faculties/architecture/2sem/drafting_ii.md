    * Types of Perspective: One point, two point & three point.
    * Views of perspective projection: Normal eye view, bird's eye view and worm's eye view.
    * Principles of one point and two point perspective view.
    * Its importance and use.
    * Difference between isometric views and perspective drawing.
    * Various exercises in perspective projection from geometrical to architectural drawings.
    * Application of perspective projection in geometrical and architectural drawings.

2. **Sciagraphy (6 hours)**
    * Introduction - Terms of sciagraphy.
    * Types of source of light: Natural and artificial.
    * Principles of sciagraphy.
    * Its importance and use.
    * Types of shadows in orthographic, parallel and perspective projections.
    * Various exercises in sciagraphy from design element to architectural drawings.
    * Application of sciagraphy in geometrical and architectural drawings.
