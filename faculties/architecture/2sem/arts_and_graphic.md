## Syllabus

**ARTS & GRAPHIC**

**Course Objective:** 
To introduce fundamentals of architectural elements and forms, geometrical forms, principles of composition, three-dimensional composition, color application, and presentational techniques in architectural drawing. To understand architectural graphics as a means of visual communication.

### Scope of Study and Its Importance (2 hours)

* Arts and drawings as a means to communicate ideas and graphic thinking.
* Elements and Forms (Points, line, plane, solid, natural and man-made artifacts, geometrical forms and objects)

### Interpenetration of Different Forms (2 hours)

* Prismatic, pyramidal, cylindrical, and conical forms
* Spherical and other forms
* Building design forms

### Basic Principles and Composition (2 hours)

* Tone (Bright and dull tone, tonal value, high, medium, and dark)
* Texture / Pencils HB, H, B (use and stress)
* Compositional development of presentation (Texture, tree, bushes/shrubs, human figure, vehicles, and clouds etc.)
* Composition (Balance, Rhythm, Scale, Unity, Harmony, Contrast, Monotony, Focal point, Hierarchy etc.)

### Color Theory & Its Applications (3 hours)

* Color (Color scheme, color wheel and its properties, uses and effects etc.)
* Use of color in architectural buildings (Exterior and Interior)
* Composition of collage, CD cover, magazine cover in different visual media and techniques

### Architectural Rendering Development Skill in Different Mediums (2 hours)

* Rendering in architectural building (Exterior)
* Rendering in architectural building (Interior)

### Preparation of a Set of Presentational Drawings of a Simple Building Using Appropriate Rendering Techniques (4 hours)

* Floor Plans including furniture layout
* Elevations
* Sections
* Site Plan
* Shadow construction in plans and elevations
* Perspective drawing (Exterior & Interior)
