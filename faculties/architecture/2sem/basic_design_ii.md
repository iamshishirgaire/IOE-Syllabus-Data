**1. Understanding of Design Standards. (6 hours)**

The students will be able to:

* Understand and investigate the measurement of the human figure and their movements in space.
* Refer to different data sources and standards.
* Explore how the basic knowledge of anthropometry is being utilized in building design.
* Consider the use of light, ventilation, and service systems.

**Exercises-1. (Group work).**

* Library research on Anthropometry and Anthropometric data with reference to international design standards.
* Compare and develop anthropometric data based on the Nepalese context.

**Exercises-2.**

Application of knowledge of anthropometric data to building program formulation through the study of different activities. Introduction of the idea of using natural light and ventilation. 

*e.g. Design of own bedroom with an attached bathroom.*

**2. Understanding of Visual Perception and Transformations of Forms. (10 hours)**

The students will be able to:

* Get inspiration from natural objects.
* Understand how perception changes with the change of color, background, and so on.
* Transform one form and shape to another to create different perceptions.
* Develop the ability to design with inspiration from nature.
* Develop further skill on freehand sketch, coloring, and model making with the creative use of different materials.

**Exercises-1.**

Make a three-dimensional sketch of any natural object and transform its shape and form to the level of abstraction by changing colors, reversing the color of the object and background, manipulating existing mass and void textures and grains, etc. Presentation in the form of a poster by composing a series of sketches of transformation.

**Exercises-2.**

Make a three-dimensional model from the final sketch with innovative use of materials.

**3. Developing Abilities to Formulate Building Program to Design of Architectural Space and Composition. (14 hours)**

The students will be able to (utilize most of the knowledge from previous exercises):

* Explore how the basic knowledge of anthropometry is being utilized in building design.
* Refer to different data sources and standards.
* Discover through the exploration of basic principles of design to apply in their own design exercise.
* Consciously (deliberately) manipulate the organization of architectural elements like floor, walls, roof, etc. to create spatial compositions of relative complexity.
* Communicate explicitly in words, drawings, and diagrams the concept of design and the knowledge gained from case studies.
* Discover through analysis of the interrelationship between the architectural composition and the context (site).

**Exercises-1. (Group work)**

Application of the knowledge of anthropometric data to building design through case studies, e.g. residences, restaurants, bookshops, showrooms, city service centers, etc.

**Exercises-2.**

Building design of a similar building to their case study in a given site.
