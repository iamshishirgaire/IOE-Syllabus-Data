## Syllabus - BASIC DESIGN- 1

**Course Objective:**  To explore fundamental principles and elements of design: form, space, composition and context.  The course will address solutions to architectonic design projects through freehand sketch, drawings and models.  Students will understand and use basic equipment, media, and techniques for communication.  This course introduces the process of architectural design and presentation.

### 1. Introduction (4 hours)

* **Understand the subject and its contents for the semester.**
* **Develop basic skills in scale free-hand drawings using drawing tools.**

**Exercises:**

* **1. (Drawings):** Draw different types of lines and symbols.
* **2.** Freehand sketch - classroom exercise
* **3.** Scales - Definition, use, and conversion. Exercise: Draw in scale plan, elevations and section of known objects (e.g., classroom furniture).

### 2. Defining Elements of Design (10 hours)

* **Discover how primary elements of design (point, line, plane, and volume) determine architectural form and space.**
* **Recognise the contrast between two-dimensional patterns and three-dimensional volumes of space.**
* **Explore how volumes of solid and void organise space.**
* **Develop the ability to select and define a concept.**
* **Manipulate architectural elements (floor, wall, ceiling, roof) to create spatial compositions.**
* **Utilize model-making techniques to produce study and presentation models.**

**Exercises:**

* **1.** 
    * Drawing exercises on point, line, plane, and volume.
    * Drawing exercises on transformation of form by additions and subtractions.
* **2.** Design of an object by composing planer elements and demonstrate how space, enclosure, and structure compliment each other to generate a form and to create a special effect when lit. The medium of communication will be the model. (E.g., Design of a lamp shed).
* **3.** Design and draw three-dimensional views of a composition of spaces illustrating the combination of base plane, vertical planes, and the overhead plane with at least three different options each.
* **4.** Prepare cardboard models of different volumes like cube, cone, pyramid, cylinder, etc.

### 3. Defining Principles of Composition in Design (16 hours)

* **Discover through exploration the basic principles of composition (Axis, Datum, Balance, Harmony, Rhythm, Scale, Proportion, etc.) to determine architectural form.**
* **Recognise the contrast between two-dimensional patterns and three-dimensional volumes of space.**
* **Explore how volumes of solid and void organise space.**
* **Develop the ability to select and define a concept.**
* **Consciously manipulate architectural elements (floor, wall, ceiling, and roof) to create spatial compositions.**
* **Comprehend and apply the properties of form (shape, size, colour, texture, position, visual orientations, etc.) to create composition and express architectonic dialogue.**
* **Analyse, identify, and respond to parameters and geometric properties of a given site/field.**
* **Express the principles of dialogue in three-dimensional compositions and in their arrangements on a given site/field.**
* **Utilize model-making techniques to produce study and presentation models.**

**Exercises:**

* **1.**
    * Prepare a measured drawing of the classroom.
    * Prepare an alternate proposal for the classroom with the manipulation of the floor plane and the roof plane.
* **2.** Prepare a composition of different volumes placed in a landscape site.
    * Prepare a site model with simple contours.
    * Reorganise the contours.
    * Fit the compositional model into the site.
* **3.** Prepare a model of a high-rise building.
    * Try to understand some of the principles of composition applied.
    * Develop skill in making a presentation model.
