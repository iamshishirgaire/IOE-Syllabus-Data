## Working Drawing

**Course Objective:**

1. After the completion of this course, students will be able to make a complete set of working drawings.
2. Students will create one complete set of manual working drawings for a 3-storey residential building of approximately 1000 Sq.Ft. plinth area, based on their own design completed in previous design studio classes.
