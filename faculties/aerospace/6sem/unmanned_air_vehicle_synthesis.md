**Practical:**

For either fixed wing or rotorcraft UAVs, create a motion planning algorithm to avoid obstacles in a continuously updated map of the environment. Limit current map visibility to a fixed range and field of view of the sensors, and identify efficient strategies that can be updated in real time. Consider always planning a safe holding pattern, and demonstrate the algorithm on forest or urban environments.
