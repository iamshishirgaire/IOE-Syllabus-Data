### Practical

1. This course is the aircraft performance, stability, and control course which most directly prepares the student for the aircraft capstone design course. Topics covered in the first part of the course help the student identify the parameters which affect takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, turn, and landing performance as well as specific excess power. Topics covered in the second part of the course include a detailed look at static longitudinal stability, with special emphasis on cg location for static stability, and an overview of dynamic longitudinal stability and response to an elevator deflection and to a vertical gust.
2. MATLAB : Most of the computer exercises have been placed in the lab associated with the class. Some assignments require computation and plotting.
