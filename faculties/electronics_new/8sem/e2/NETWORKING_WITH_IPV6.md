### Practical

For practical exercises, each student will have access to a PC (either in a virtual environment or real environment). Students will be divided into groups of 3. The working environment and machine connectivity will resemble the following:

**Tools Needed:** TCPDUMP & WIRESHARK

1. Enable IPv6 in Windows/Linux
2. IPv6 Header Analysis
3. IPv6 Packet analysis (neighbor/router solicitation/discovery)
4. Unicast Routing Implementation using Zebra-OSPF & OSPF phase analysis
5. Multicast Routing Implementation using XORP-PIM/SM & PIM/SM phase analysis
6. IPv6 DNS/WEB/Proxy implementation & test
7. Case Study
