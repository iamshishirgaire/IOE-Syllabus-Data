In the initial phase the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions as to the approach of the project. In the later phase the student will be left on his own to pursue his work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem crops up. He should then compile project work â€“I and project work II write ups and submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct the mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.
