# Syllabus

**APPLIED MECHANICS (DYNAMICS)**

**Course Objectives:**  
The purpose of the course is to provide basic knowledge of engineering mechanics dynamics portion to the students such that they can understand the basics of kinematics and kinetics for both particles and rigid bodies and their motion.

1. **Curvilinear Motion of Particles (4 hours)**
2. **Kinetics of particles: Energy and Momentum Methods (5 hours)**
3. **System of particles (5 hours)**
4. **Kinematics of Rigid Bodies (6 hours)**
5. **Plane Motion of Rigid Bodies: Forces, Moments, and Accelerations** **(4 hours)**
6. **Plane motion of rigid bodies: energy and** **momentum methods (6 hours)**

**Tutorials:**  
6 tutorials, 2 mini projects
