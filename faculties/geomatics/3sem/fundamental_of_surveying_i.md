**Course Objectives:**  
The objective of this course is to introduce Geomatics engineering students with the basic knowledge of land measurement and surveying techniques. The overall course is designed to make the students able to learn and understand the theory and practice of basic survey measurements.

1. **Introduction** **(1 hours)**
2. **Theory of Measurements and errors** **(8 hours)**
3. **Introduction of traditional survey** **(4 hours)**
4. **Leveling** **(6 hours)**
5. **Theodolite and theodolite traversing** **(6 hours)**
6. **Tacheometry** **(6 hours)**
7. **Contouring** **(6 hours)**
8. **Electronic Distance Measurement and Total Station** **(8 hours)**

**Field/Practical:**

1. A field demo of compass, plane table survey (3 hours)
2. Two peg test and differential leveling (3 hours)
3. Traverse survey (6 hours)
4. Computation and adjustment of traverse (6 hours)
5. Develop a computer program of traverse adjustment (6 hours)
6. Detailing by tacheometry method (9 hours)
7. Data download (3 hours)
8. Preparation of contour map (6 hours)
9. Generate contour using computer software (3 hours)

Three assessments: mean of three will be final marks
