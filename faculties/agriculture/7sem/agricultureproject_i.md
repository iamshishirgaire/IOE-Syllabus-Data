## AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING PROJECT (PART I)

**Course Objective:**

The objective of Agricultural Engineering Project work is to provide students with hands-on skill development and practical learning. This involves design, development, fabrication, testing, evaluation, and exploitation of solutions to Agricultural Engineering problems within a chosen specialization area. 

* Each project group consists of at least 4 students.
* Each group is guided by a team of specialized faculty members designated by the Agricultural Engineering Department.
* A task is assigned to each group at the beginning of the fourth year, with a specified completion deadline.
* A project report, in prescribed format, must be submitted to the department by the due date.

**Agricultural Engineering Project (Part A):**

This part exposes students to preparing and presenting technical papers and reports on issues related to Agricultural Engineering Project (Part B), which will be completed in the second part of the fourth year. 

* Each group prepares a project proposal.
* The project proposal is presented by the group in a technical forum or department setting.
* Following the seminar presentation, a final project proposal must be prepared and submitted to the department.
* Faculty and guest speakers are invited to present seminars on topics related to Agricultural Engineering to enhance the project work.
