## AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING PROJECT (Part II)

**Course Objective:**

This is the continuity of project work assigned to students in fourth year part A. The objective of Agricultural Engineering Project work is to provide the students opportunity of hands-on skill development and practical learning involving design, development, fabrication, testing and evaluation and experimentation on Agricultural Engineering problems pertaining to any one specializing areas–Water Management, Soil Conservation and Watershed Management, Farm Power and Machinery and Process and Food Engineering. The students shall work (at least 4 in a group) under the guidance of a team of specialized faculty member/s designated by the Agricultural Engineering Department.

The group of students assigned a task at the beginning of fourth year shall be required to complete the task within the due date of the second part of fourth year and submit a final project report in prescribed format. Viva-voce conduction and project work evaluation will be done at the end of the semester with the help of expert of related field.
