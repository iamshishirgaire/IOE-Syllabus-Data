The purpose of Field/Industrial Training is to expose students to real-life and field-based works in areas relevant to Agricultural Engineering and Technology. 

A group of students will be attached to appropriate industries/institutions where they will be required to accomplish tasks mutually decided upon by faculty members in Agricultural Engineering at IOE and personnel from collaborating industry/institutions. As far as practicable, students will be given the option to select industries or agencies depending upon their choice for elective subjects.

The field/industrial training will be scheduled during the winter/summer vacation and the total duration of the field/industrial training will be 4 weeks.
