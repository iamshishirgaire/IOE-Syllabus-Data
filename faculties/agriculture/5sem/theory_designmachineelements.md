**Practical:**

1. **Pro-active learning approach:** Each student will carry out a research project. S/he should write 4-8 pages summary on her/his topic and deliver it taking 10-15 minute time. The sample topic may be one of the following:
    * Design for manufacturing
    * Material selection for gear
    * Design for assembly
    * Optimal design
    * Value engineering
    * Patenting 
    * Bench marking
2. **Undertaking Design project:** One team of the student will be 2 to 3 in number and it will complete a design project of a product on:
    * A gravel conveyor
    * A garage door opener
    * A lifting device
    * A maze planter
    * A sprinkler
    * A mechanical jack to lift and lower the load
3. **Live field project:** Mechanical design related industrial problems as an assignment.

**Tutorial:**

1. Problem solving on related topics.
2. Old questions of TU examination will be the base for tutorial classes.
3. Number of numerical examples in each chapter should be solved in the classes according to the weight-age given for TU final examination.
4. Preference is to be given for applied type of questions that includes synthesis and analysis of real problem of machine design.
