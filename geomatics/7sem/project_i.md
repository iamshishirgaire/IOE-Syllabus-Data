**PROJECT WORK I**

**Course Objective:**  
The objective of the project work is to equip the students with skills required to synthesize comprehensively the knowledge gained during course works for a practical application of Geomatics engineering discipline in real life. Under the supervision and guidance of member/members of faculty each student is required to carry out an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling problem to civil Engineering and is required to submit a project report.  
The choice of project will depend upon the interests of students, faculty and the facilities available in the campus.  
A project may involve:
1. Preparation of a design for an extensive Geomatics Engineering project
2. Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey and a correlation of existing knowledge
3. An experimental investigation

The project work is divided into two parts, viz Project –I and Project –II. In Project-I students are required to complete following works for above mentioned categories of project works:

1. **Design type project**
2. **Dissertation type project**
3. **Experimental type project**
<p>In the initial phase the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions as to the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on his own to pursue his work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem crops up. He/She should then submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct the mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.
