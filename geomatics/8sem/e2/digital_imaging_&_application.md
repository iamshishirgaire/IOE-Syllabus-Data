# Syllabus

**DIGITAL IMAGING AND APPLICATION**

**Objectives:**  
The course aims on introducing digital image processing (IP) and computer vision (CV) concepts. It explores the methods and algorithms enabling the students to important IP/CV systems or use IP/CV software with emphasis on remote-sensing and photogrammetry applications. The course components include: digital image acquisition and sampling image enhancement in the spatial and frequency domain, Color image processing, image restoration, image segmentation, image compression and multi-source image/ data fusion.

**Course outline:**

1. **Introduction** **(1 hour)**
2. **Fundamentals of digital image** **(2 hours)**
3. **Image enhancement in spectral domain** **(6 hours)**
4. **Spatial processing** **(6 hours)**
5. **Image enhancement in frequency domain** **(9 hours)**
6. **Image segmentation** **(6 hours)**
7. **Image restoration and reconstruction** **(6 hours)**
8. **Color image processing** **(3 hours)**
9. **Image compression** **(6 hours)**

**Tutorials and Practical:**  
The tutorial should be detail guideline and should be explain at least once before going though the practical. The handout should contain questions pertaining to the basic concepts, analysis and application of each practical such that student can understand and visualize the concept behind the tutorial and practical component of the course. The tutorial and practical can be carried out using MATLAB or ENVI/IDL tools

1. Image Enhancement techniques at the spectral, spatial and frequency domain:
2. Image Segmentation
3. Colour Image Processing
4. Image compression

**Three Assessments:** The average of Three assessment will be the final internal mark
