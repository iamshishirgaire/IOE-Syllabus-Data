**FIELD SURVEY II**

**Objectives:**  
The course in Geomatics Engineering Field Works are intended to introduce the students different type of survey instruments and its calibration and practice in team to prepare map and geomatics engineering survey and computation.

**Field Surveys:**  
A three week (144 hours) field camp at suitable nearby site will be conducted prior to start of IV/I lectures (Off Campus, closed field work).  
Prepare a desk report prior to depart to field.  
Field exercise includes:

1. Precise instrument familiarization and calibration
2. Topographic mapping
3. Boundary survey problems
4. Astronomic Azimuth
5. Photographic control survey
6. Deformation survey
7. Geodetic control survey
8. Satellite and inertial survey
9. Gravity survey
10. Remote sensing problems
11. Land information systems problem

Emphasis is placed on practical and professional experience and students participate in organization, planning, scheduling, and logistic aspects of field operations. In addition to group field reports on each exercise, each students is required to prepare a complete report on one selected major exercise.
