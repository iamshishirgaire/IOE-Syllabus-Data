# Syllabus

**APPLIED MATHEMATICS**

**Course Objective**  
This course focuses on several branches of applied mathematics. The students are exposed to complex variable theory and a study of the Fourier and Z‑Transforms, topics of current importance in signal processing. The course concludes with studies of the wave and heat equations in Cartesian and polar coordinates.

1. **Complex Analysis(18 hours)**
2. **The Z-Transform(9 hours)**
3. **Partial Differential Equations(12 hours)**
4. **Fourier Transform(6 hours)**
