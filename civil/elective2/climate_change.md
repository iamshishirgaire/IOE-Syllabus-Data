**CLIMATE CHANGE**
**CE 76516**

**Course Objectives:**

This course broadens knowledge on fundamentals of climate change with respect to climate change science; and its causes, effects and uncertainties about climate change. It broadens the idea on technology, technological options for mitigating climate change, adaptation measures, risk analysis, economics, policy options and their impact on outcomes.
