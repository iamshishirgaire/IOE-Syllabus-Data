## Syllabus - Groundwater Engineering (CE 76509)

**Course Objectives:**

Groundwater Engineering is the first course in the physics of saturated flow in porous media with engineering applications. The course includes topics such as groundwater occurrence and Darcian flow, well hydraulics, pumping tests for finding aquifer parameters, overview of methods for groundwater explorations, tube-well construction methods and design, pump selection for lifting groundwater and economics of groundwater utilization. Moreover, the course gives an overview of groundwater resources of Nepal.

    * Basic definitions of terms in groundwater hydrology with illustrations: Aquifer, Aquiclude, Aquifuge, Aquitard, Types of aquifer with illustrations - confined, unconfined, leaky, perched.
    * Properties of soil/rock affecting groundwater flow: porosity, storage coefficient, specific yield.
2. **Fundamentals of Groundwater Motion (8 hours)**
    * Review of continuum approach and REV with specific reference to groundwater flow.

    * Definition of hydraulic conductivity, permeability (with their typical values), aquifer transmissivity, aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy.
3. **Potential Groundwater Flow Theory and Flow Net Analysis (8 hours)**
    * Plotting stream lines, equipotential lines, and flow net in groundwater.
    * Direction of groundwater flow from piezometric head observations.
    * Analysis of water table maps.
    * Derivation of Laplace equation and its use in steady groundwater flow in isotropic and anisotropic media.
