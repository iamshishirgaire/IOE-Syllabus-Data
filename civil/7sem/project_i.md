## PROJECT WORK – I

**Course Objective:**

The objective of the project work is to equip students with skills required to synthesize comprehensively the knowledge gained during course works for a practical application of civil engineering discipline in real life. Under the supervision and guidance of faculty members, each student is required to carry out an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling problems in Civil Engineering and is required to submit a project report.

The choice of project will depend upon the interests of students, faculty, and the facilities available on campus.

A project may involve:

1. Preparation of a design for an extensive Civil Engineering project
2. Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey and a correlation of existing knowledge
3. An experimental investigation

The project work is divided into two parts, viz. Project –I and Project –II. In Project-I, students are required to complete the following works for the above-mentioned categories of project works:

1. **Design type project**
    * Background
    * Project Description
    * Study Area
    * Literature Review/Guidelines etc.
    * Methodology
    * Field data collection and plotting
2. **Dissertation type project**
    * Background
    * Need of the research
    * Objectives and scope of the work
    * Literature Review
    * Study area
    * Methodology
    * Data collection and compilation
3. **Experimental type project**
    * Background
    * Need of the research
    * Objectives and scope of the work
    * Literature Review
    * Experimental setup
    * Methodology
    * Data collection and compilation

In the initial phase, the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions regarding the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on their own to pursue their work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem arises. They should then submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the supervisor can correct any mistakes. The final report should be submitted to the Department Head in duplicate.
