## Syllabus

**THEORY OF STRUCTURES I**

**Course Objectives:**

The purpose of this course is to provide concepts and knowledge of structural analysis with an emphasis on statically determinate structures. By the end of this course, it is expected that students will be able to perform analysis of determinate structures both by manual calculation as well as matrix methods of analysis using computer applications.
