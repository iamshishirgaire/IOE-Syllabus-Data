### Evaluation Scheme

The questions will cover all the chapters of the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

| Chapters | Hours | Marks Distribution* |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 2 | 6 | 10 |
| 3 | 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 5 | 10 |
| 5 | 4 | 8 |
| 6 | 7 | 12 |
| 7 | 5 | 8 |
| 8 | 5 | 8 |
| 9 | 2 | 4 |
| 10 | 6 | 10 |
| **Total** | **45** | **80** |

**\* There could be a minor deviation in the marks distribution.**
